                  - Hanji kaise ho app sab, main hitesh aap sab ka chai or code me swagat hain.
                - Chai aur Caddy dekha kya?
                - I saw a startup and build it. Multi LLM response POC. Here is a walk through on how to build an open source version of it as your next project. Video is up at ChaiAurCode youtube channel.
                - Hanji, Aajao n discuss krte h 1 complex project ka infra and design. Ye project OpenAI and Stream ke upr h and aapko 1 next level complexity sikhayega. Bht kuch explore krne ko milega, source code b available h and video ChaiAurCode pe available h. Attendance laga do
                - Thoda late night h but hope chalega aapko. 1 full stack nextjs application with AI integration. Response and streaming both are covered, vo b Hindi me. Chai aap le aao, code hum krwa denge. Comment me attendance laga dena video pe.

                - I just love PhonePe approach. They studied everything about existing UPI apps. This included paytm, who thought we have 1st movers advantage. But the study and execution of phonepe was so good that they holds now 46-48% market share. You can start anytime and challenge anyone. Just study well and execute it calmly.
                - BTW, it‚Äôs around 7 hours and I am recording more.
                - System design was always popular in sr. Developers but now that popularity is growing in freshers, the subject will get segmented.
                  You will see:
                  Frontend system design
                  Backend system design
                  Database system design
                  Infrastructure system design (aws, AI, etc)
                - Chai aur code pe new video dekha kya?
                - 2 folks from same company enrolled in our GenAI batch. We do a project of AI powered interview builder in that cohort.
                  These 2 folks build it, polished it, presented it and sold a subscription within their company.
                  Their CEO just pinged, wanted to enroll whole team in next batch and wants to hire from batch so that they can offer AI services to clients. I love this corporate transition.

                - That‚Äôs a lot of zeros and ones.
                  A lot of love from all of you. A lot of people started their programming journey here and still are enjoying fresh stuff. It took over a decade of hard work and I am still enjoying the journey. I can easily do it for next decade too.
                  Coding, teaching and making videos is not a job for me, it‚Äôs my meditation, it‚Äôs my freedom. I left various big offers silently because there is nothing that can give me same amount of satisfaction. I still record videos late night, I am sure you might have seen those 4am timestamps. That‚Äôs an outcome because I truly love it.
 
                  Because of your love and this long journey I was able to put a small impact on world. I was able to change at least 1 person‚Äôs life for good.
                  I will see you in another video ‚ù§Ô∏è
